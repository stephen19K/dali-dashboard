I made this project for the DALI Dev II Challenge using:
 - [React](https://reactjs.org/)
 - [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/)
 - [React-Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/)

## Installation
- Clone this repo
- Make sure you have Node, React, Leaflet, and React-Leaflet installed
    - https://nodejs.org/en/
    - npm install react
    - npm install leaflet
    - npm install react-leaflet

- Navigate terminal to the directory you cloned this repo into
    - ex: `Documents\GitHub\dali-dashboard>`
- Run the command `npm start`
- You're done!

## Usage
You can navigate around the map using arrow keys or click-and-drag. To zoom in and out, use the buttons in the top-left of the screen or your scroll wheel.

Hovering over a member's icon will show you their name and greeting in a Tooltip. Click on their icon to bring up a Popup containing:

- `Name`
- `On Terms`
- `Projects`
- `Personal Website`
